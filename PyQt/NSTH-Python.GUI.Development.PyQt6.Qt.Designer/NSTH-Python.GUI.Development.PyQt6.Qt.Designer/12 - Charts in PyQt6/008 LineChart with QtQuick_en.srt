1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,910
So we have already saw that how we can create our charts using pie.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,750
Now how we can create our charts using QTC and also QML.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,060
That's called markup language.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,860
Now the first chart that we want to create, that's called line chart.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,960
So let me create my QML file in here and let me just say line chart dot qml.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,620
Now i already have a complete section on using QTC and also QML.

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,050
So before starting off this this section you can also check that section.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:49,970
Now the first thing is that we are going to import our question here so we can just import qtquick 2.5

9
00:00:50,210 --> 00:01:01,070
and also we are going to import QTC dot controls.

10
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,040
We can add the version and also we need to import charts.

11
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,770
So charts 2.5.

12
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,750
Now after this, let's create our application window in here.

13
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:23,120
And the first thing is that we need to create our window so I can just make it to true.

14
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:31,710
And also we can add a width of 600 and also a height of 400.

15
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,440
Now we can give a title to the window and that is line chart.

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,060
So.

17
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,910
And now we have created our dot HTML file and right now we can not run this.

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,160
We need to create another python file and we need to load our this dot HTML file.

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,490
Let me just create a another python file and let me just call it load.py.

20
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,400
So now let's create our let's add our imports.

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:16,110
So first from HTML, we are going to import QML application engine and also from core we are going to

22
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,040
import.

23
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,870
Q.

24
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:30,740
Object and from cutesy widgets, we want to import application.

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,380
Also, we are going to import sass.

26
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,910
Now let's create our window class that extends from object.

27
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,610
And let's create our init and also super.

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,050
And let me just remove this.

29
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,050
We do need that.

30
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,380
Okay.

31
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:01,850
Now, after this, let's create the object of our application or the instance of the application in

32
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,150
here.

33
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:09,500
We can pass this.org or if we're not using a command line utility, you can just leave it an empty list.

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,170
After that, we need to create the engine.

35
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:22,460
So in here I can just say engine QML application engine and after creating of the engine, now we can

36
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,710
create our window in here.

37
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:35,800
Also, we need to register our window and the context of the HTML so we can just say engine dot.

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,770
Root context.

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,320
Art.

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,650
Set context property and we can say window and we can add our window.

41
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,730
So after doing this now it's important point.

42
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:57,940
Now we need to load our QML file so we can use engine dot load and we can give the name of the queue.

43
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,840
So line chart dot qml.

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,250
And at the end we can just execute our app.

45
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,800
So app dot execute.

46
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,410
Now let's run this.

47
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,970
Run the load.

48
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,570
So we are not seeing anything.

49
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,290
It means that we have a.

50
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,940
Problem in here.

51
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,650
Application window.

52
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,740
Visible through width height.

53
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,180
So now the problem is in here.

54
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,640
I have a typo, so it's pretty quick.

55
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,470
Let's run it again.

56
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,470
Now you can see that we have our window in here.

57
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,950
Now let's create our charts.

58
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,540
So we have already imported our this cutie charts in here.

59
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,520
Now, so first, let me just comment this.

60
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,380
And now up first, I need to create my chart view in here.

61
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:09,880
And as I've already said, for creating our charts, first we need to create chart view and also we

62
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,110
need to create chart.

63
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,930
So in here we just we need to, we need chart view and here we do need to create chart.

64
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,870
We can just create, add our charts and the chart view.

65
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,960
So now I can just say anchors dot fill.

66
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,710
And I can just make it patent.

67
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:37,260
We can just say anti aliasing and we can just make it true.

68
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,200
Also, we can set the theme for this.

69
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,870
For example, chart view dot chart.

70
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,690
The team dark.

71
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:57,370
So now, after creating off the chart view, now we can add our line series in the chart view.

72
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,520
So I can just say line series.

73
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:11,490
You can add the name, for example name, and I can just say line series.

74
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:20,520
Now we can add our pints, so we can just say x, y pint and we can add the x pint.

75
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,230
So for example, zero and also Y to zero.

76
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,250
We can add another one.

77
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,420
So x, y, pint and.

78
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,990
X 1.1 and Y.

79
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,290
2.1.

80
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,890
Let's copy this.

81
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:59,660
And the X should be, for example, 1.9 and this should be 2.5.

82
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:10,040
For example, a 2.1 and it should be 3.11 or whatever.

83
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,760
You can just.

84
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,320
We want to add some data, some data points in here for the X and Y position.

85
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,660
3.4.

86
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,780
And four pint.

87
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,420
To.

88
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:36,650
And the last one is, for example, 4.3 and 3.1.

89
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,430
So now if I run this.

90
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,240
You can see that we are not seeing anything.

91
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,850
And that's because because we also need to add a cutie charts.

92
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,560
Now if I run this.

93
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,410
I am not seeing anything.

94
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,910
Let me first comment this and let's check that.

95
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:12,070
Where is the problem chart team talk and and here we have error like this and t it should be like this.

96
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,510
Let's run it again.

97
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,040
So we are not seeing any chart.

98
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,320
And that's because because we haven't imported the charts.

99
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,920
And again, we have problem.

100
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,210
And anti.

101
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,690
And this is the problem again, Ali.

102
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,850
It should be like this.

103
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,510
Yeah.

104
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,340
Now you can see that we have our line series in here.

105
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:50,020
And if I comment this, for example, and if I run this, you can see that we are not seeing any charts

106
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:56,170
because we need to import along with these we and also controls.

107
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,240
We need to import -- charts.

108
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,930
And if I run this, you can see that we have our line chart.
