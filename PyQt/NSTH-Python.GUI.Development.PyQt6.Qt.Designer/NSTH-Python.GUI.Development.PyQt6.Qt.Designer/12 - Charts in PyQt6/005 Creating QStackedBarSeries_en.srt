1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,000
We have already studied how we can create a person bar series and picked.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:13,200
Now, in this lesson we want to create a stacked bar series and we are going to create a temperature

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,130
bar chart.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,950
Now let's create our example.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:27,060
So I've already copied my window code and let me change the title to a stacked bar series.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:34,810
And now I need my imports from picked6 dot charts.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,520
I'm going to import a cue bar set.

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,050
Q.

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,750
Stacked Bar series.

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,400
We need a Q value axis.

11
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,590
Q Chart.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,270
Q chart view.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,080
And also Q Bar category access.

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:10,890
Now let me create my, uh, bar set in here so I can just say low Q bar set, and let me just say mean.

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:20,190
And also I can just give high and we can say Q bar set and let's add Max in here.

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,210
Now we need to append some data to the these bar sets to the low and high.

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,370
So let me just paste the data.

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,490
And these are the data that I'm going to add.

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,570
So low dot append.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,800
These are the set of the data and the list of the data.

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,440
And after that for the high also I'm going to append some value in here.

22
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,360
After that, we need to create our stacked bar series.

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,820
So series Q stacked bar series.

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,370
And now we can append our High and low and the Stacked Bar series.

25
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,150
So series dot append.

26
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,150
And we can add our low and dot paint.

27
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,340
We can add the high in here.

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Now, after this, let's create our chart in here and also we can add the series to the chart.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:31,670
Also, we can set the title so I can just say temperature

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,790
record and for example, sell CEUs like this.

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,480
And after this, now we need to create our category.

32
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,790
So these are some categories of the month that I have pasted in here.

33
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:58,560
And let's create our, uh, category axis so I can just say axis X.

34
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,980
Uh, Q bar category.

35
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,890
And now we can append.

36
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,200
So dot append, and we can add the categories in here.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:19,300
And also we can just set the title, not title phone, but it should be, uh.

38
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:28,390
Subtitle, title, text, and we can just say Matt and.

39
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:38,480
So now after setting the title text, now we can add that to the chart.

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:53,810
So chart dot add axis and we can just add axis X and also we need to import from picked6 dot cuticle.

41
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,490
We are going to import acuity.

42
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:05,480
We need to give the alignment for this axis so we can just say cutie dot alignment, flag dot align

43
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:17,570
bottom and after this we can create the chart view in here and we can just say chart view and let's

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,480
add that in the chart to the chart view.

45
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:27,410
And also we can just say self dot set central widget to the chart view.

46
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:35,070
So before this, let's create our so we have created our axis X.

47
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,480
Also we need to create axis Y so that will be a value for the value axis.

48
00:04:42,480 --> 00:05:00,480
So in here we can just say axis y and Q value axis and let's add a dot set range -52 and also 52.

49
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,560
Now let's set title.

50
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,390
Title Text to temperature.

51
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,730
And so we can add the sign of the degree in here.

52
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,740
So this is the sign of degree.

53
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,830
And after that we can add that to the chart.

54
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:33,170
So dot add axis, axis y dot alignment, flag dot align left.

55
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:43,070
So we want to add this in the left of the chart and now we can just say series dot attach.

56
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,000
Access.

57
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,100
So the first one is X, and also we can attach the Y.

58
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,780
So now let's run this.

59
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,400
So we should run this from here.

60
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

61
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,510
Now you can see that we have our temperature record, and this is our temperature data.

62
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,350
And we have a stacked bar chart in here also.

63
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,670
These are the months.
