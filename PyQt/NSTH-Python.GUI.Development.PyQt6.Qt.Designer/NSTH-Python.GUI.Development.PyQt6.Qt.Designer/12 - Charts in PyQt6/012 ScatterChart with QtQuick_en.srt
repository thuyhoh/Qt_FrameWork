1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,530
This is the last chart that we want to create and that will be scatter chart and quick.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,730
Now let's create our example.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:19,310
Let's create a dot HTML file in here and I'm going to just call it scatter dot HTML.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:31,310
And let me just open this pie chart because we are going to copy some codes from here and paste it in

5
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,360
this section.

6
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,980
Okay, now let's create our scatter series in here.

7
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:59,670
Hope you can give ID so the ID is scattered one and the name is scatter one and let's add x, y pint.

8
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,530
So for the x, I want to give it 1.5.

9
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,040
And for the Y we can just say 1.5 and let's.

10
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,010
At some more points in here.

11
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,760
For example, I can change this to, uh.

12
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,530
Another volume and five, for example, five, five.

13
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:38,330
And I can just make it five seven and make it 1.8.

14
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:52,830
And like this, for example, one pine tree and also, uh, 2.5 and 2.1.

15
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,180
So let's just copy this.

16
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,550
And we want to add one more, uh, scatter series in here.

17
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,710
And let's change the ID to scatter, to scatter to.

18
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,520
And we can change the value to two point.

19
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,920
And 2.1.

20
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,550
2.5.

21
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,460
2.57.

22
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,320
And.

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,990
Uh, let's just make it like this, okay?

24
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:39,110
So now let's add this scatter dot QML and our this engine dot load scatter dot HTML.

25
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,580
Now if I run this so you can see that we have some points in here.

26
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,300
Scatter one.

27
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,180
So this is the scatter one and for the scatter two also we have some points in this section.
