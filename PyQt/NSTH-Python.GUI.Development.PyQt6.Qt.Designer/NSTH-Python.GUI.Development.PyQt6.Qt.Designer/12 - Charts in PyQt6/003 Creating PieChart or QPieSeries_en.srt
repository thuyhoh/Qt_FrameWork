00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,810
In this lesson, we want to learn that how you can create pie chart or pie series and picked.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,630
So now let's create a practical example.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,640
Let me create a new python file in here and I'm going to just call it pie chart dot pie.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,270
So first of all, we are going to just add our window code in here and we can change this to main window.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,820
And let me change this to main window and we can add a window title.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,030
So let me just say pie chart.

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,590
Now after creating of our main window.

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,330
Now let's add some imports from Pict six dot acuity charts.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:56,640
We are going to import a chart Q chart view and also cube pie series like this.

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,190
After this, let's create our method in here and I'm going to just call it diff pie.

11
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,250
And in here first we need to create our pie series.

12
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,930
So pie series.

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,150
And after that we can add some, we can append some data.

14
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:28,580
So for example, we can just start Python and we can add the value in here series, dot append and cplusplus

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:40,100
and we can add a value in here series dot append, we can add a Java and after that we can add a value

16
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,710
and also dot append.

17
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,550
We can add C-sharp and let's add a volume here.

18
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,660
So after adding this, let's create our chart in here.

19
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:57,630
So I can just say chart chart and now we can add our series to the chart.

20
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:05,820
So chart dot Add series and we want to add our series in here after this.

21
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:14,160
We need to create chart view in here so I can just say chart view and we can add our chart in the chart

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,700
view.

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,810
And at the end we need to just set the central widget.

24
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,220
So self dot set central widget to the chart view.

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,420
Let's call our this solve dot pie chart in here.

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,750
And now if I run this, you can see that Now I have a pie chart in here.

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,700
Also, you can add animation or set animation for your pie chart.

28
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:51,490
So for example, up in here we can say chart dot, set animation options.

29
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,650
Chart dot animation options dot all animations.

30
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,340
And also we can set the title.

31
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,140
So dot set title.

32
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,060
Or we can just say pie chart.

33
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,450
Pie chart.

34
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,090
Example.

35
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,930
So now if I run this, you can see that we have a simple animation.

36
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,040
And also, let me just run it again.

37
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,170
So we have animation and also we have title in here.

38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,560
Also you can add a theme for the chart.

39
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,650
So for example, in here we can just say chart, dot, set.

40
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,890
The team.

41
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,640
And also now we can add the type.

42
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,510
There are different types that you can use.

43
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,450
Chart team dot, for example, chart, uh, Team Blue.

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
So you can see that we have, uh, it's changed.

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:08,520
And also you can add, uh, legend, uh, for right now, if you see in here, uh, we have the legend

46
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,540
in this section.

47
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,610
Now, if you want to make it disable, you can just use chart dot legend.

48
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,470
Uh, dot set visible, and we can just make it to false.

49
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,600
So if I run this, you can see that we don't have the legend in here.

50
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,570
Now, let me just comment this, uh, also, you can change the position of the legend.

51
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,130
So right now it's on the top.

52
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,770
You can just make that to the bottom.

53
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,870
So for example, we can use dot legend, dot set alignment.

54
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,390
And first we need to import.

55
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,710
So from core, we are going to import.

56
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,370
And in here we can use dot alignment, flag dot line bottom.

57
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,230
So if I run this and now you can see that this legend is in the bottom.

58
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:09,480
Uh.

59
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:21,510
Also, you can add a slice for the chart, for the pie chart for that in here, let me just say add

60
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,380
a slice.

61
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,000
So misspelling.

62
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,380
Add a slice.

63
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:39,240
Now we can say my slice and we can use series dot slices and I want to add the slice for index two so

64
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,630
you can see zero index one index and this is index two.

65
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:51,990
I want to add a slice for the Java and we can just say my slice dot set, explode it and make this to

66
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,590
true.

67
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,060
And also we can just say my slide dot set label visible and we can make it to true.

68
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:07,050
So now if I run this, you can see that now we have the Java and it's exploded and we have the slice

69
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,190
of Java in here.
