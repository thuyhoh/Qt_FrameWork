1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,310
In this lesson, we want to create a donut chart and peaked.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,220
I'm going to create a new Python file and let me just call it donut dot pi.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,520
And this is my code for creating of the window.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,020
So donut chart.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,800
And after this Now donut chart is a type of pie series.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,550
So for that we need to import a pie series.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:37,080
So from chart we are going to import Q chart, Q chart view and also Q pie series.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,010
Now let's create our pie series.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,490
So Q Pie series.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,910
And after that we can add a hole size.

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:58,290
So dot, uh, set hole size and I can give the hole size in here and also we can append.

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,700
Uh, some text in here.

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:13,310
So for example, some data also, uh, protein 4.3% and I can add 4.3.

14
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,510
And also let's create our slice.

15
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:32,180
So my slice series dot append, and now we can add fat 15.6% and we can add the volume here.

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,790
After that, we can just say my slice dot set, explode it and make it a true.

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:51,400
Now we can append also, for example, I can just say other 30%

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,470
and dot append, uh, carbs.

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,730
57%.

20
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,070
And now let's create our chart.

21
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,440
Chart and we can add the series to the chart.

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:24,490
So add series like this, we can set animation dot set animation options.

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,110
Queue chart.

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,160
Dot animation options dot You can use all animation grid axis animation.

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,050
Let me just use series animations.

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,220
Set the title dot set.

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,390
Uh, title to do not chart.

28
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,420
Uh, also we can set theme.

29
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,340
So dot set.

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,960
Uh, and there are different theme that you can use.

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,330
So we can just use, uh.

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,200
Let me just use this brown sand.

33
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,630
And after this, we need to create the chart View.

34
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,120
Chart.

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,900
View.

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,300
Chart View.

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,980
And let's add the chart and the chart view.

38
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,260
And at the end we can just say self dot set central widget to the chart view.

39
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,320
And let's run our code.

40
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,420
And now you can see that we have a simple donut chart in here.
