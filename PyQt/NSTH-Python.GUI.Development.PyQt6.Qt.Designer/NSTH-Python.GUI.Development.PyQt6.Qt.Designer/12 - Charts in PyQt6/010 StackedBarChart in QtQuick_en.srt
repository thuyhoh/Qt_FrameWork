00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,430
In this lesson, we want to learn that how we can create a stacked bar chart or a stacked bar series

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,450
using quick and QML.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,010
Let's create another python file, not python but qml file.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:26,700
And let me just call it stacked bar dot qml and we can just add or copy some codes.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:35,190
So first we are going to just add these codes in here and let me change the title to uh, stacked.

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,170
Bar chart.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,270
And let's close this.

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,380
Close this.

9
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,030
And now in here, we can create our stacked bar city.

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,080
So we can just say stacked bar cities like this.

11
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,020
We can add an ID.

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:08,000
So for example, my cities and let's add our some quotes from Barchart dot HTML and we can just grab

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,360
these quotes and add it in this section.

14
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,750
So we want to use the same data and there is no problem.

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,290
Let's add this to the load.py file.

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,440
So a stacked bokmal and we can run this.

17
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,700
So now we can see that we have a stacked bar chart in here.
