1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,120
In this lesson, we want to create a bar chart or bar series.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:14,600
Let me create a new python file in here and I'm going to just call it bar chart.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:21,710
And so this is my simple window code and let me change the title to bar chart.

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,890
So now first we need to add our imports dot charts.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,100
We are going to import chart.

6
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,600
Our chart view and also Cube bar series.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,020
And also we need to import cube bar set.

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,940
Or we need to add a percent bar series.

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,070
So percent bar series.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,500
Now let's create our add Create bar app.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,450
So first we need to create our setting here and we can just say Q bar set.

12
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,690
And let me just add some names in here.

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,030
Set one.

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,970
AQ bar set

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,390
and let me just copy and paste.

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,710
This.

17
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,710
So this is, uh.

18
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,020
Let me just add a name in here, and we can change this to bar set to.

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,860
And also we can create another one.

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,210
So this is the last one.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,810
And I can add a name and we can change this to bar set three.

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,210
So after creating of our sets.

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,750
Now let's add some data to these bar sets.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,690
Now let me paste the data.

25
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:58,270
So these are some data that I have added in the bar sets some value.

26
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:05,640
And after adding this, now let's create our series in here so we can just say Series Cube person,

27
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,750
City Bar series, and now we can append the sets in here.

28
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,860
So set.

29
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,830
Zero and dot append.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,570
Set one.

31
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,600
Dot append.

32
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,130
Set two and dot append.

33
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,350
And this is set three.

34
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,810
So after creating this, let's create our chart in here.

35
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,860
So chart.

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,600
Chart.

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,960
And we can add the series in the chart.

38
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,050
And after that we can create our chart view.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
In here chart view.

40
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,410
And let's add the chart and the chart view.

41
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:00,530
And after that we can just say self dot set central widget to the chart view.

42
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,200
Now let's run this and the bar chart.

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,040
So we are not seeing any chart because we need to call this.

44
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,090
So self dot create bar.

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,360
Now you can see that we are seeing our bar charts in here.

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,400
You can add some, for example, animations or title to the chart as we have already done.

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,890
And we can just say chart dot, set animation options, chart dot animation options dot for example,

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,030
all animations, we can add titles.

49
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,870
So chart dot, set title and we can say bar chart.

50
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,100
Example.

51
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,430
Now, also you can add a theme for the chart.

52
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:07,390
So you can just say chart dot set, and we can just say chart dot chart, theme dot.

53
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,450
And there different we are going to use, for example, dark.

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,580
And now if I run this so you can see that this is our chart.

55
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,399
We have a theme and also we have animation for that.
