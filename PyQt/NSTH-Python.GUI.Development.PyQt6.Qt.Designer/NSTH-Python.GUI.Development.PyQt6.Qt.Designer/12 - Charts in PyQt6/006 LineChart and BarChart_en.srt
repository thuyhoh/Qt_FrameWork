1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,620
Let's create our line chart and also bar chart together.

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,510
I can create a new python file.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,930
And let me just say line bar chart.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:22,390
And this is our simple code for creating out the window line line chart and.

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,420
Bar chart.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:37,730
So now let's add our imports in here, so from kutty charts, we are going to import Kubra Buckyball

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,180
set.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,710
We need a CubeSat series.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,300
We need to chart view and also queue chart and also queue line cities.

10
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,140
So and here first, we need to create our basket.

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,890
So let me just start at zero Q Marcet and we can just act.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,480
Some names in here, and let me just copy this.

13
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,340
For example, Bob.

14
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,240
And also, we can create another one, and this should be told.

15
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:36,520
And let me just add another one, and this should be Mary and also Sam.

16
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,360
Now, let's change this to Borsa to three and also four.

17
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:51,550
So now after creating of the bar set to now, we need to add some detail where upends some data to this

18
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,280
to this these baskets that we have created.

19
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:01,260
Now, let me paste my data in here so you can see that these are data that I have appended to the to

20
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,810
the sets.

21
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,360
And after this, let's create our bar series in here.

22
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,480
And I can just take your bar series and let's print the sets.

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:28,570
And the boss's daughter open societies set zero and got up and set one and bar dot append and we have.

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,610
Said to.

25
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:45,660
Bar series dot upand we can set three and bar series dot a pan, and this is set for now author this

26
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,350
Let's create our line series.

27
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,700
So line series and cue line series.

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,060
And now we need to add some pine sauce, some data to the line series.

29
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,150
So let me just import queue point if.

30
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,760
So from Dodd Cuticura, we are going to quote you pint.

31
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,550
If so, we are going to add floating point in here.

32
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,570
Now let's create our chart.

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,340
So chart two, chart view, cue chart.

34
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,930
And now we can chart dot cities.

35
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,210
We want to add more series.

36
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,270
And also we need to add the line series.

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,690
And also, we can set title.

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,010
Wine and bar chart.

39
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:57,260
Let's create a chart view, CEW chart view, and we can add to the chart and the chart for you.

40
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:03,710
And then we can just say so dots at central widget to the chart.

41
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,660
Do the charts for you.

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,310
So now let's run this.

43
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:21,260
Now you can see that we have our line chart and also we have our bar chart.
