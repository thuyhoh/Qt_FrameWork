1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,920
In this lesson, we want to learn that how we can install pie charts and also how you can create your

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,990
first line chart using pie cutie.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,270
So first of all, what is line chart?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,500
Now line charts are typically presented as a series of pints, or we can say markers that are connected

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,390
by lines and a line chart.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,390
The points are connected by straight lines to show the changes of the variables over period of time.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,150
Now let's create a practical example.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:37,520
Now, before creating of our example for the line chart, we need to install pie charts because by default

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,380
we don't have charts and pie cut.

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:47,360
And for that we need to install a pie charts library so you can just use Pip install and after that

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,620
the library name.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,870
Let me just install this.

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,930
And here in the terminal we can just paste this and after that hit enter.

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,920
Now, if you're using Pyqt5, then you need to install this library.

15
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:10,400
You cannot use this library for pyqt5 and for Pyqt5.

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,890
You can just use this library.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,000
Now our pie charts has been installed.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,260
So let's create another directory in here and I'm going to just call it part seven.

19
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,380
And in here we are going to create a new Python file.

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,200
And let me just call it line chart.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,890
So first, let's create our first window using pie cut.

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,800
And so first we need some imports, dot cut widgets.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,510
We are going to import application and also main window.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,090
After that we are going to import dot cut.

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,030
We are going to import queue icon because we want to add an icon for our window.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:07,350
Also, we need to copy the icon folder from here from part one and we can add that in the part seven.

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,610
And in here we have just a simple python dot PNG.

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,490
And after this we need to import our charts library.

29
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:29,010
So from Python six dot cut up charts we are going to import Q chart and also Q chart view.

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,010
Now, when you're going to create charts, these two are important.

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,820
Now we will have a Q chart and after that we will have a chart view.

32
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:44,050
We can add the Q chart to the chart view, and after that you can add the type of the chart that what

33
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,310
type you want to create.

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,650
For example, we are going to use Q line series.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,290
Now, Q line series means that we want to create a line chart and also we are going to import says.

36
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,730
So now let's create our class window.

37
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,340
And this class extends from main window.

38
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,680
I'm not going to describe all of them because I've already described that you can create your first

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,390
window using pie cut and we can just create this in here.

40
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,860
And let me just add my init and also super function in here.

41
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,270
So dot.

42
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,360
Uh, in it.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,000
And after this, let's set the geometry of the window.

44
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:32,300
It means the X and Y position and also the width and height of the window.

45
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,510
Also, we need to set the window title.

46
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,790
So set window title.

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:48,260
And I can just say, for example, our line chart and we can set the icon.

48
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,610
So set window icon and it expects icon.

49
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,680
We have already imported icon in here and here you can give the name of the icon.

50
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,330
So that is in the images folder we have Python dot PNG.

51
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,150
Now let's create the instance of the application class.

52
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,010
So in here I can just say app application.

53
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,209
I can pass this dot argument V or argv.

54
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:24,040
After that, we can create the object of our window class and now we need to show the window and at

55
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:31,270
the end we need to execute our app so we can just say sess dot exit, app dot execute.

56
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,460
So now if I run this, you will see that I have just a simple window.

57
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,770
Now let's just create our line chart or line series.

58
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,480
So the first thing is that in here I'm going to just create a method.

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,840
So I'm going to just call it diff line chart.

60
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,560
And after that we need to create our line series.

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,360
So line series.

62
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:05,730
And now we need to append some data or we can say some points to this series or line series.

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,640
Now in here we need to import another class.

64
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:21,180
So from Picked6 dot core, we are going to import cube point F, so cue point f.

65
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:31,880
And now up in here, we can just say dot append and we can add a list in here, a list of Q point F,

66
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:47,600
So we can just give some points in here like this and Q point F, we can add another one like this.

67
00:05:48,620 --> 00:06:04,520
Q point F, uh, three and 268 And also we can just use some more Q point F, So it's a floating point

68
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,550
four and.

69
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,730
Like this.

70
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,250
Let's create another one.

71
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,830
And this is five.

72
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,530
120.

73
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,810
And the last one.

74
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,950
Let's give another one.

75
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,480
And this is the last one.

76
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,040
We can just give it 210 like this.

77
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,500
So after adding our pints to the line series.

78
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,810
Now we need to create a chart.

79
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,160
The object of the chart.

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,430
As I've already said that in every for example, every chart that we want to create first, we need

81
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,420
to create the instance of the chart, and after that we need to create the chart view.

82
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,700
We can add the charts and the chart view.

83
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:56,920
Now let's say chart chart and now we can add our series in the chart.

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,890
So add series and we can just add it in here.

85
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,460
And after doing this, we now we need to create our chart view.

86
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,530
And now I can just say chart.

87
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,450
Chart.

88
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,690
View.

89
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,200
Chart View.

90
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,540
Let's add the chart and the chart view.

91
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,570
And after that we can set the central widget to the chart view.

92
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,070
Now let's call our line chart.

93
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,320
So self dot, line chart.

94
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,170
And now if I run this.

95
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,770
So you can see that we have a line chart in here.

96
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,780
Now you can add some more options in here.

97
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,520
For example, we can create a default axis in here.

98
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,820
So we can just say create default axis and also we can set a title.

99
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:59,430
So set title, we can just say line chart example.

100
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,860
Now you can see that we have some default axis.

101
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,770
And also we have our line chart in here.

102
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,930
Line chart title.

103
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,700
Also, you can add animation.

104
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:19,030
So you can just say chart dot set animation options.

105
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,580
There are different animations that you can use.

106
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:29,190
So if we say animation options dot, you can see we have all animations, we have series animations,

107
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,810
for example, if I choose all animations.

108
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,820
And if I run this, you can see that we have a nice animation here.

109
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,169
Let me just run it again.

110
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,390
So this is the animation that we have.

111
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,620
And if I say, for example, series animations.

112
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,370
So you can see that we have another type of animations in here.

113
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,420
Also, you can set a theme for the chart.

114
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:01,620
So I can just say chart dot, set theme, and then here we can use chart.

115
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,760
Also, there are different chart theme that you can use.

116
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,700
For example, we can use a chart theme dark.

117
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,460
And if I run this so you can see we have a dark, dark theme for this.

118
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,390
So like this you can create a line chart and peaked.
