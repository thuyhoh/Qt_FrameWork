00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,800
In this lesson, we want to create pie series or pie chart using qtquick.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,040
Now let's open our PyCharm and create our example.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,950
I'm going to create a new XML file.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,150
And let me just say pie chart dot HTML.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,260
And as always, we can copy these codes from here.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,510
Because I don't want to write these again.

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:36,500
And let's close this, close this and change this to pie chart.

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:45,290
And in here we can just say pie series.

9
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,520
Let's add ID to this.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,130
So for example, Pie series and also we can add pie slice.

11
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,050
We should have the label.

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,470
So, for example, we can give Python and the value.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,960
We can give a value for this.

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:21,970
Let's create another pie slice and the label is cplusplus and the value is 80.

15
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,910
Pie slice.

16
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:35,360
The label is Java and this is not comma, but it should be like this.

17
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:46,330
So Java and the value is 60 pie slice.

18
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,150
The label as.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,330
C-sharp.

20
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,580
And the value is 40.

21
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,640
And now we can just add this to the engine dot load pie chart.

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,130
And let's run load.

23
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,380
Now you can see that we have our pi charm and qtc and also QML.
