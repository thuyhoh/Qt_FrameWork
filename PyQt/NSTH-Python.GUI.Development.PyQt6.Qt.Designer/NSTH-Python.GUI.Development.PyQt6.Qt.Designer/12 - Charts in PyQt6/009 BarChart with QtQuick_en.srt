00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,880
In this lesson, we want to create a bar chart or bar series using QTC and also QML.

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,750
So let's create a new python file in the file, not python file.

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:22,030
And I'm going to just say barchart dot qml and we can copy some codes from here.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:29,260
Let me just copy these codes because I don't want to write these codes again.

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:36,010
And now let me just change this to Barchart.

6
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,390
And now we can create our bar series in the chart view.

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,870
So we can just say bar series.

8
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,920
We can add the ID.

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,320
So for example, my cities.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,200
Now we can add our axis X and bar.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:08,250
I got a goody axis0 and here we can add our categories and I can just say cata.

12
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,390
Goodies.

13
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,530
I can add some here.

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,530
So like this.

15
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,850
Now after adding these categories, let me just add one more.

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:53,890
Now we need to create our bar set so I can just say bar set and we need to give the label in here.

17
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:01,120
So for example, I can add some names and after that you need to give the values.

18
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:11,360
Two, two, three, four and five, six.

19
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,980
Okay.

20
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,250
And now let's just add.

21
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,810
Another one.

22
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:29,960
So, for example, John, and we can add some volume here, for example, 5 to 3, or we can just say

23
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,680
two, three.

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,000
And also let me change also this to five.

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,250
Change this to Bob and we can add some value in here.

26
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,390
Five eight Like this.

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,910
Okay.

28
00:02:51,990 --> 00:03:03,630
So now let's just, uh, first we need to add this bar chart to the load engine dot load, bar chart,

29
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,970
dot HTML, and let's run this.

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,100
Uh.

31
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,170
Now you can see that we have our bar chart and if I run it again.

32
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,660
So this is our bar chart with the data that we have.
